XMRig compiled with gcc for old rPIs 1/2

XMRig / XMRigCC is a high performance Monero (XMR) CPU miner. Originally based on cpuminer-multi and completely rewritten from scratch on C++.
These are the CPU-mining binaries for armv6/v7.

Ensure that you have the required libraries installed on raspbian by running
sudo apt-get libuv1-dev libssl-dev libhwloc-dev -y

None of this is my work. Just thought I'd upload for others.
