XMRig built with gcc-7.4.0 for old rPIs 1/2

XMRig is a high performance Monero (XMR) CPU miner. Originally based on cpuminer-multi and completely rewritten from scratch on C++.
These are the CPU-mining binaries for armv6/v7.

armv6 will be uploaded shortly.

None of this is my work. Just thought I'd upload for others.
