XMRig built with gcc-7.4.0 for old rPI 1/2

XMRig is a high performance Monero (XMR) CPU miner, with official support for Windows. Originally based on cpuminer-multi with heavy optimizations/rewrites and removing a lot of legacy code, since version 1.0.0 completely rewritten from scratch on C++.
This is the CPU-mining version for armv6/v7.

None of this is my work. Just thought I'd upload binaries for others.
